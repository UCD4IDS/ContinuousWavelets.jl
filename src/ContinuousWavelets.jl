"""
    ContWave{Boundary,T}
The abstract type encompassing the various types of wavelets implemented in 
the package. The abstract type has parameters `Boundary<:WaveletBoundary` and
`T<:Number`, which gives the element output type. Each has both a constructor,
and a default predefined entry. These
are:
- `Morlet`: A complex approximately analytic wavelet that is just a frequency
    domain Gaussian with mean subtracted. `Morlet(σ::T) where T<: Real`. `σ`
    gives the frequency domain variance of the mother Wavelet. As `σ` goes to
    zero, all of the information becomes spatial. Default is `morl` which has
    σ=2π.
- `Paul{N}`: A complex analytic wavelet. `pauln` for n in `1:20` e.g. `paul5`
- `Dog{N}`: Derivative of a Gaussian, where N is the number of
    derivatives. `dogn` for `n` in `0:6`. The Sombrero/mexican hat/Marr wavelet
    is `n=2`.
- `ContOrtho{OWT}`. OWT is some orthogonal wavelet of type `OrthoWaveletClass`
    from [Wavelets.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDSP/Wavelets.jl). This uses an
    explicit construction of the mother wavelet for these orthogonal wavelets
    to do a continuous transform. Constructed via `ContOrtho(o::W)` where `o`
    is from Wavelets.jl. Alternatively, you can get them directly as
    `ContOrtho` objects via:
   + `cHaar` Haar Wavelets
   + `cBeyl` Beylkin Wavelets
   + `cVaid` Vaidyanthan Wavelets
   + `cDbn` Daubhechies Wavelets. n ranges from `1:Inf`
   + `cCoifn` Coiflets. n ranges from `2:2:8`
   + `cSymn` Symlets. n ranges from `4:10`
   + `cBattn` Battle-Lemarie wavelets. n ranges from `2:2:6`
